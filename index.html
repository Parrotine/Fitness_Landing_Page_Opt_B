					<h2>Strength and Balance</h2>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Sitting shuts off the electrical activity in your muscles. When standing, you engage more muscles in your legs and core, improving your strength, balance, and overall fitness.</p>

					<h2>Metabolism and Calorie Burn</h2>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>Sitting turns off fat-burning enzymes and slows metabolism to a crawl. Standing up reverses this process and burns more calories. In fact, by standing instead of sitting for 4 hours a day in a 5-day work week, you burn enough extra calories to equal a 10k run.</p>

					<h2>Energy and Focus</h2>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>When you stand up, your heart rate increases, circulation improves, and your blood glucose level drops. All of this adds up to a more stimulated brain and focused mind â€“ the best antidote to that afternoon slump.</p>

					<h2>Get More from Your Workouts</h2>
				</div>
				<div>
					<p>For every hour you spend sitting, you can lose up to 16% of the benefits you gain from a workout. At a sit/stand desk, you&#39;re more likely to stand up, move around, and maintain more of the benefits of exercise.</p>
